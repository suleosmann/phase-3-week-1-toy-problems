# Coding Challenges Readme
This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges implemented in Python. Each challenge focuses on different problem-solving aspects, such as string manipulation, conditional logic, and value calculation.

## Challenges:
### Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
Task: Convert a given 12-hour time to 24-hour time format.
Function: convert_to_24_hour(hour, minute, period)
Example:
Input: convert_to_24_hour(8, 30, "am")
Output: 0830
### Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive
**Task**: Determine if exactly two out of three given integers are positive numbers.
**Function**: exactly_two_positive(a, b, c)
##### Example:
**Input**: exactly_two_positive(2, 4, -3)
Output: True
### Challenge 3: Consonant value
**Task**: Calculate the highest value of consonant substrings in a lowercase alphabetic string.
**Function**: solve(s)
**Example**:
**Input**: solve("zodiacs")
**Output**: 26
